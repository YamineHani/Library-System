# Library System Frontend 

This project focuses on developing a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for the library system, following the backend implementation.. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for administrators and librarians. 
## Project Structure

### Package Organization:

1. **`backend`:**
   - Contains classes from Lab4 (AdminRole, LibrarianRole, Book, LibrarianUser, StudentBook).
   - Access modifiers are set to ensure that only necessary classes can be accessed from outside the package.

2. **`frontend`:**
   - New package for GUI-related classes.
   - GUI builder-generated classes representing various windows of the library system.

3. **`constants`:**
   - Package for storing interface constants related to file names and login credentials.
   - `FileNames` interface contains file name constants.
   - `LoginCredentials` interface stores login credentials for admin and librarian access.

## Usage
 -`ADMIN_USERNAME` = "admin"
 -`ADMIN_PASSWORD` = "12345"

 -`LIBRARIAN_USERNAME` = "librarian"
 -`LIBRARIAN_PASSWORD` = "56789"

Best of luck with your project!
